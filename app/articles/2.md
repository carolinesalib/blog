# First day using RSpec

Before starting I want to share two resources I like to use when writing tests;
[Better Specs](https://www.betterspecs.org/) and [RSpec - Relish](https://relishapp.com/rspec/).
I learned how to write tests by checking these two sites and therefore many of the examples I'll give will be based on
that.

## Basic Structure

The first thing to notice when wring tests with RSpec is it's structure of `it`, `expect`, `subject`, `describe` and
`context`.


The methods `it` and `expect` are necessary to write an effective test. 

```ruby
describe DumbClass do
  it "returns true" do
    expect(1 == 1).to eq(true)
  end
end
```

The `subject` is exactly what the name says, it is the subject of our test. Usually the subject is an instance of the
class we are testing.

```ruby
describe DumbClass do
  subject { DumbClass.new }
  # or
  subject { described_class.new }
end
```

Note that we can use the method `subject` without declaring it. RSpec it will automatically call `described_class.new`
in this case.

```ruby
describe DumbClass do
  it "returns the subject class" do
    expect(subject.class).to eq(DumbClass) # it will pass
  end
end
```


Even though `describe` and `context` do the same thing under the hood, they are meant to be used in different
situations. We should use `describe` to describe our classes and methods and `context` to organize our tests
scenarios.

Good practices tips:

- Describe **class methods** starting with `.`. Example: `.method_name`
- Describe **instance methods** starting with `#`. Example: `#method_name`
- Start contexts with one of these key words: `when`, `with` or `without`

```ruby
describe CarRental do
  describe "#rent" do
    context "when there is a car available" do
      it "returns rented car" do
        expect(subject.rent.class).to eq(Car)
      end
    end

    context "when there is no car available" do
      it "returns false" do
        expect(subject.rent).to eq(false)
      end
    end
  end
end
```

## "Let" me tell you something

We use `let` do declare "variables" for our tests. The reason to use `let` instead of regular ruby variables is that
`let` will cache the result of it's call in the same example, but not in different examples.

```ruby
$count = 0
describe "let" do
  let(:count) { $count += 1 }

  it "does not change count value in the same example" do
    expect(count).to eq(1)
    expect(count).to eq(1)
  end

  it "is not cached across examples" do
    expect(count).to eq(2)
  end
end

# Run this using --order defined to respect the order of the expectations
# bundle exec rspec spec/dumb_spec.rb --order defined
```

The difference between using `let` and `let!` is that `let` is lazy-evaluated the first time it is called and `let!` is
evaluated before each example. The most common use case to use `let!` is when we are testing an object and we need
something to be created before the test run, like a database record, for example.

```ruby
describe FindUser do
  let!(:user) { User.create(name: "User Test") }

  describe ".by_name" do
    it "finds user by name" do
      # User with name "User Test" needed to be created first so it will return in this method
      expect(FindUser.by_name("User Test")).to eq(user)
    end
  end
end
```

One thing that is confusing about `let` is that in order to work it can only be declared in some places of our tests.

* Declare your `let` inside `describe` or `context`
* **Do not** declare your `let` inside `before` or `it`
* Feel free to declare normal ruby variables inside your its

```ruby
describe CarRental do
  # Inside a describe: works
  let(:example) { User.create(name: "User Test") }

  describe "#rent" do
    context "when there is a car available" do
      # Inside a context: works
      let(:example) { User.create(name: "User Test") }

      before do
        # Inside an before: doesn't work
        let(:example) { User.create(name: "User Test") }
      end
      
      it "returns rented car" do
        # Inside an it: doesn't work
        let(:example) { User.create(name: "User Test") }

        new_variable = "User Test" # this is ok
        expect(subject.rent.class).to eq(Car)
      end
    end
  end
end
```

## FactoryBot - creating fake data

First we need to keep in mind that when we are testing models in Rails, all the data persisted is persisted in a test
database and not in our regular development database. Now that we have this clear, lets talk about how to persist data.

Usually when working with Rails and RSpec, we will use a gem called
[factory_bot](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot) to help us persisting data. When using FactoryBot we are able
to generate ActiveRecord models templates with pre populated data, including the model relations which can be very handy.

```ruby

# TODO example creating factory bot model
# TODO example of a trait
```

How to use it

```ruby
# TODO: example of FactoryBot.create or just create
# TODO: talk about build
# TODO: talk about creating a list 
```

In addition to FactoryBot, another gem called Faker....
