<h1>About</h1>

<h3>About me</h3>
<p>Born in Brazil and living in Canada since 2019.</p>
<p>I'm a software developer passionate about code quality, automated tests and open source projects. As a software developer, I also love the feeling of fixing broken things and building software that will have value to others.</p>
<p>My favourite language is ruby (combined with rails). I also have experience working with react js and interest in learning new languages such as elixir. I'm curious and love to learn and test new things.</p>
<p>When I'm not working, I like to spend time playing video games (Playstation, Xbox or Nintendo) and staying with my family (my partner, dog and two cats).</p>

<h3>About this site</h3>
